# so_long

> A simple 2D game project from 42 school using the MiniLibX graphical library.

## ‚úÖ Description

`so_long` is a small 2D graphical game where the player must collect all items on a map and reach the exit. The project focuses on basic window rendering, image handling, event management, and pathfinding validation.

## üéÆ Game Objective

- Move the player across a map.
- Collect all collectibles (`C`) on the map.
- Reach the exit (`E`) after collecting all items.
- Avoid invalid moves (like walking into walls `1`).
- Count and display the number of moves.

<br>

## ‚öôÔ∏è Build

This will generate the executable `so_long`:

```bash
make
```

To execute this program you should use `./so_long` with the map you want to play, as in the example below:

```bash
./so_long maps/map1.ber
```

NOTE: You can create your own map and test it in the executable or you can use the premade maps in the folder `maps`.
